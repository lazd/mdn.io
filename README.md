# mdn.io

> The "I'm feeling lucky" URL shortener.

## Why?

The [Mozilla Developer Network] is an awesome JavaScript resource. When looking for JavaScript references on something like `Function.apply`, you might use a search engine with "apply site:developer.mozilla.org" and click the first result.

mdn.io does that for you, and can be configured to [search any domain](#searching-other-domains).

#### Use it in comments when explaining concepts

```javascript
// Make sure add() takes a single argument (see http://mdn.io/Function.length)
expect(queue.add.length).to.equal(1);
```

#### As a [lmgtfy] replacement for JavaScript questions

> **friend:** dude, is it `call()` or `apply()` that takes an array?

> **you:** mdn.io/apply

#### Type directly in the address bar as a shortcut to search the MDN

> [mdn.io/bind](http://mdn.io/bind)

> [mdn.io/closure](http://mdn.io/closure)

> [mdn.io/cross origin sharing](http://mdn.io/cross%20origin%20sharing)

## How does it work?

mdn.io uses DuckDuckGo's "I'm feeling lucky" functionality to redirect you to the first search result.

Note that, because this is a search, the page you're redirected to may change in the future. However, you can rest assured that you'll always be redirected to the page that DuckDuckGo finds most relevant.

## Searching other domains

mdn.io can be used to search any domain. See the [configuration](#configuration) section and fire up your own instance.

## Development

```sh
npm install # Install dependencies.
npm start # Start server locally.
```

### Configuration

Configure mdn.io with the following environment variables:

| Variable            | Description                                          | Default                                               |
|:------------------- |:---------------------------------------------------- |:----------------------------------------------------- |
| **`PORT`**          | The port to run the server on.                       | `3000`                                                |
| **`SERVICE_URL`**   | The search service URL to use.                       | `https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%21%20%s`                  |
| **`SEARCH_DOMAIN`** | The domain to search.                                | `developer.mozilla.org`                               |
| **`FALLBACK_URL`**  | The fallback URL for empty queries.                  | `https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript` |

**Alternative service URLs:**

* Google - `https://www.google.com/search?btnI&q=%s`
* Bing - `http://www.bing.com/search?q=%s` (Bing does not have an "I'm Feeling Lucky" equivalent, you'll be redirected to the search result page instead)

#### Example: Reddit URL shortener

`SEARCH_DOMAIN="reddit.com" FALLBACK_URL="http://reddit.com" PORT=8080 npm start`

## Deployment

```sh
npm run deploy
```
